# MATLAB-Isolated-Word-Recognition-System
This is a simulation of an isolated word recognition system, implemented entirely in MATLAB. It uses an MFCC-DTW algorithm, which is computationally cheap and thus well-suited for embedded systems with limited resources.


NOTE: to use the system, please unzip the training files. There are A LOT of them and github does not like me uploading that many files at once in a single directory.
